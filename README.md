# learn_solidity
I am currently learning Solidity Smart Contract development from the youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M576WGiDBdQ

In this video the instructor is walking step by step creating contracts of increasingly complex nature. I want to use this repository as my library to review these codes as often as needed.

# learn_solidity
I am currently learning Solidity Smart Contract development from the youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M576WGiDBdQ

In this video the instructor is walking step by step creating contracts of increasingly complex nature. I want to use this repository as my library to review these codes as often as needed.

# Changes to Code from lectures
I am not using the exact same code as lecture, instead making tweaks to the code that help me better understand the nature of Solidity. For example -

* In the FundMe.sol, I added modifications that allows the Contract Owner to select how much fund will be withdrawn from Contract Balance instead of withdraawing all the funds at one go

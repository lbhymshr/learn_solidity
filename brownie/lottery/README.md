### Rules of the Game

1. Users can enter lottery with ETH based on a min USD fee (currently set to $50)
* If users are already in the lottery, then they can simply add to their stake by entering more ETHs
* The more the stake the better the chances of winning the lottery

2. An admin will decide when the lottery is over
3. The lottery will select a random winner

How do we want to test this?
1. `mainnet-fork1`
2. `development` with mocks
3. `testnet`
